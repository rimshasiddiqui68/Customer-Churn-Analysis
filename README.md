## ‚úÖ Recommendations

### ‚Ä¢ Revamp Promotional Offers
Since "competitors making better offers" is the top reason customers are leaving, it's crucial to update our promotional strategy. More than half of our customers aren't aware of any current offers. By boosting advertising efforts and highlighting new promotions, we can better capture their attention and keep them interested.

### ‚Ä¢ Enhance Customer Support
About 12% of customers left because they were dissatisfied with the attitude of our support staff. Offering additional training for our support teams can help improve customer satisfaction and ensure our service feels welcoming and responsive.

### ‚Ä¢ Improve Fiber Optic Service
Customers using our Fiber Optic internet have a higher likelihood of leaving, probably due to device issues and the higher price compared to other types of internet services. Since many of these customers rely on streaming services, boosting the connection quality and rethinking our pricing strategy could make Fiber Optic more attractive and reduce churn.

### ‚Ä¢ Offer Flexible Contract Options
Our current contract choices‚Äîmonth-to-month, yearly, and 2-year plans‚Äîoffer little price variation, which may discourage long-term commitments. Introducing discount rates for long-term contracts and adding options like 3-month and 6-month plans could provide the flexibility customers seek and encourage longer commitments.

### ‚Ä¢ Retain At-Risk Customers
Even among our loyal customers, around 65% are at high risk of churning. To keep these customers engaged and satisfied, consider introducing measures like exclusive discounts on monthly bills, a points-based loyalty program, or personalized incentives based on their usage patterns. These targeted efforts can make customers feel valued and encourage them to stay with the company for the long term.

### ‚Ä¢ Recommendation for Senior Citizens
Senior citizens often face difficulties with complex plans and tech support, which can lead to frustration and higher chances of leaving. To better serve this group and improve retention, the company should introduce ‚Äúfamily bundles‚Äù where senior citizens can be added to their family members‚Äô plans at a discounted rate. This adds value while keeping them connected with loved ones. Offering regular feedback or check-in calls, and a dedicated support team trained to assist elderly users with patience and clarity can significantly enhance their overall experience and build long-term trust with the brand.
